# Rock Paper Scissors Game
My second project working through TheOdinProject!
Currently works in-console only.

## Instructions:
1. Download **app.js** and **index.html** to your local machine in the same folder.
2. Open **index.html** in your browser
3. Access your browser console (Ctrl+Shift+J in Chrome)
4. Type ``game(num)`` into your browser console, replacing ``num`` with a positive integer value of your preffered number of rounds.
5. Press Enter and Enjoy! Results are displayed in the console after every game.
