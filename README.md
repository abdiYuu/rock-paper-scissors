# Rock Paper Scissors Game
My second project working through TheOdinProject!
Currently works in-console only.

## Instructions:
1. Download the repo to your local machine.
2. Open the **index.html** file in your browser
3. Access your browser console (Ctrl+Shift+J in Chrome)
4. Type ``game(rounds)`` into your browser console, replacing ``rounds`` with a positive integer value of your preffered number of rounds.
5. Press Enter and Enjoy! Results are displayed in the console after every game.
